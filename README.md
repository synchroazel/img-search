# Image search engine

An image search engine trained on 10 random animal classes from ImageNet, developed for a university project.

The following project had been proposed as a competition, in which each group had to build and train their engine and
test it on a new dataset on the competition deadline.

The following is adapted from the assignment sheet:

## Objective

The main objective of the project is to create an image search engine where a query image is fed to a model that will
return the most N similar images from a gallery. Given the input query image, the algorithm has to be capable of
matching the input query image with another gallery image depicting the same animal. The expected algorithmâ€™s output is
a list of ranked matches between the query image and the gallery images.

A secondary objective of the project is to learn how to collect data. As we are seeing during the course, collecting a
large amount of data is crucial for ML applications. Therefore, you are required to largely expand the provided training
data in order to improve your algorithm performance on the test set.
